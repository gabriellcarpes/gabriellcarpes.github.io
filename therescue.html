                <p>
                    The Rescue is a map designed for the Table-top RPG Cyberpunk RED. Players are tasked with locating and extracting a hostage from a three story building. A biker gang is using this building as a base of operations and a weapons market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map is designed to support player agency by giving them several options as to how to approach the situation. It is also designed to provide an underlying tension and pressure to the players as the gang can overwhelm them if they are careless.
                </p>

                            <p><i> Garage Building floors drawn by hand.</i></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This is the main area of the level and where most of the action takes place. It has four stories one of them being the basement.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Basement
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Players can access the basement from the sewers via a collapsed wall. There are guards on the passageway but there are cameras pointed at the waterfront and a mine in the sewers that can be triggered by careless players.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Ground Floor
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Public area where bikers set up a market stall where they sell guns out of. It is accessible by anyone but filled with bikers either working as guards or just lounging about and working on their vehicles.
                            The front offices are for high-profile deals and players may use their social skills to score a meeting there which might give them an opportunity to sneak into the rest of the building.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Second Floor
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Restricted area filled with bunk beds for the bikers to sleep in. Players can find disguises and equipment here that may help them sneak around the building with more ease.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Third Floor
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Restricted area. The players objective is on this floor. There is also a security room where one biker keeps watch on all cameras. Players can also access the rooftop from this floor.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            Rooftop
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            This is another restricted area with very sparse features. There are two bikers here distracted in conversation. This area is accessible from the third floor or from the building across the street.
                        </p>

                            Completely public, players and all NPCs can wander and stay in the street as long as they don’t cause violence

                            GARAGE BUILDING
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Controlled by the Biker Gang. Access is mixed. The ground floor is semi public with a weapon market that players can enter and interact with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The front offices can be accessed by the players if the Bikers agree to it and they accompany the players. This can be done by wanting to purchase a high value of weapons and will require either to show proof of cash or bluffing. Other floors are restricted and guards will answer trespassers with violence
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            APARTMENT BUILDING
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Semi-public. The building is almost entirely abandoned and only has squatters living in it. No one will prevent players from entering and going through the hallways into the roof, but residents will prevent players from entering their homes
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            WATERFRONT
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Restricted access but not many guards. The Waterfront is guarded by the Biker Gang with security cameras but not guards

                        <p>
                            In order to keep the mission dynamic, some events may trigger to change the conditions of the map. Some events can be actively triggered by players.
                        </p>
                        <h5>

                        <p>
                            Although the basement is not guarded, if players access the building through it two guards will make their way to the basement distracted and talking loudly. <br />
                            This event raises tension for players that just made it to the building stealthly and now face a surprise obstacle, however, since the guards are distracted and being loud, players have an opportunity to take them by surprise.

                            The elevator is broken and stuck on the third floor. Players can use the elevator shaft to secretly go up the building up to the second floor. Alternatively, they can release the elevator and make it crash into the basement, creating a distraction.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When the players reach the second floor mezaninne or when they reach the third floor coming from the roof they will hear the bikers on the ground floor saying that their boss is on the way. This is a dangerous enemy that can easily take down the players, so they will be encouraged to move faster towards their goal.
