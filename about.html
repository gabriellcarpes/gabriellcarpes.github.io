													Personal
												</h4>
											</header>
											<p class="col-12">
												I was born and raised in Porto Alegre Brazil where I lived for most of my life. I graduated in Architecture and Urban Planning in 2015 and made a living as a photographer and a web developer before going into game development.
												<br>
												People consider me a funny person, and I like to make other people laugh. I also really love cooking, baking and pets in general.
											</p>
											<p class="col-12 col-md-8">
												If we are friends then I&apos;ll probably offer to bake some sourdough bagels for you. Here&apos;s a picture of how they usually look. <br> <br>
												I also bake cakes, muffins and sourdough bread but these are rarer. Recently I nailed a recipe for a double chocolate chip cookie.

											</div>
											<p class="col-12 mt-4">
												I also enjoy short videos that end just as things are about to go horribly wrong. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ax27VgI-lVE">back at is again at Krispy Kreme</a> is my favorite

													When I was an artist
												</h4>
											</header>
											<p class="col-12">
												I used to work as an independent artist and architecture photographer for about 6 years. During that time I showcased my work in Europe and South America.
												I also published a book called <i>1000 Years From Now</i>. It&apos;s a visual study of the political period in Brazil between the years of 2016 and 2018.You can find more details about it 
												<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gabrielcarpes.com/1000-years-from-now">here</a>,
												<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gabrielcarpes.com/1000-years-book">here</a>, and 
												<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gabrielcarpes.com/1000-years-about">here</a>. You can also find some of my Architectural Photography work there.

											<header class="mb-3 col-12">
												<h4 class="mb-2">
													I also play Dungeons and Dragons (and other tabletop games)
												</h4>
											</header>
											<p class="col-12">
												Surprising, I know! But I also play Dungeons and Dragons. I&apos;ve been DMing for around three or four years and I love it every time. I also really love boardgames, the most recent one that I&apos;ve played is Coup.
											</p>
											<p class="col-12">
												In the past I used to make miniature terrain for Dungeons and Dragons too. I used to make them out of foam from scratch and paint them by hand. It was really fun and some of them turned out pretty good!
